		description: `HOLDING TANKS: - Depending on the size of the tank I recommend using 1 x 30 gram tablet (white) for 7 days usage , add more as required. The tablet is similar to the 8 gram but more economical for such tanks.If you have a boat/yacht etc sea water can be used and with a Masurator suggest crush the tablet install pieces to prevent from jamming. If you have the small bottle Mini tabs enclosed in your packaging I suggest use the same method as shown above for the bowl & seat.

The Mini Oxygen Tab in a spray bottle lasts around 3 weeks can be used in the kitchen, Bathroom on bench tops etc and has NO perfume. (You do not have to wait for the Mini Tab to fully dissolve, just use it!)

GREY WATER: - I recommend using the 30 gram tablet can be placed on the far corner of the shower base , this will clean out the pipe lines leading to the tank, also can be placed directly intothe tank.

You do not have to wait till the mini tab fully dissolves. We use the spray bottle for the bowl & seat, which only takes seconds & in the heat perhaps spray the bowl 3 times a day. By spraying it is killing the bad bacteria & any odour, it is good to open the slide when spraying to allow entry into the bottom cassette.	(You do not have to wait for the Mini Tab to fully dissolve, just use it!)

		Use any toilet paper & if it is not breaking down use more flushing water.`,
